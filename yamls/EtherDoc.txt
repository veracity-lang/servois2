NoterEth, pronounced "Notaryth", is a prototype notary and "Proof of
Existence" DAPP. By submitting hashes of documents you can proof on a
later date that you were privileged to certain information at a point
in history. The transfer of documents can enable other contracts to
allow certain access based on who owns a hash.
